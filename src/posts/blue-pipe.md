    alt="Picture of a diagram of a dense lattice. The lattice is flanked on the right side by motors as seen from above, each a little squat rectangle that represents the spinning wheel, with a long pipe emerging downward from the wheel's center. On the left side, the lattice is flanked by a thick vertical pipe and a nest of smaller lines around it. Woven throughout the lattice is are two blue lines bending at right angles."

On the left side, the lattice is flanked by a thick vertical pipe and a nest of smaller lines around it. Woven throughout the lattice is a forked, nearly black line bent at right angles, with five branches channelling from left to right into a single trunk."
