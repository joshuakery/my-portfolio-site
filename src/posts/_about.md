My family’s history—and my role in writing it—is central to my work. The participation of my family members in my practice is crucial to understanding the way we share stories and have taught each other to make art. I focus on how we transfer our knowledge and history, orally and through the accretion of artifacts. Our shared material forms the bases of many of my projects, executed through a range of media—including photography, drawing, video, and web development—all of which respond to the diverse nature of the objects in question. 

I am an interdisciplinary artist with a background in Fine Arts and Human Computer Interaction. I work as a Learning and Engagement Contractor at Design Museum Everywhere and as a freelance web designer and developer. I have exhibited solo at the Frame Gallery in Pittsburgh, and collaboratively at MuseumLab, the Frank-Ratchye STUDIO for Creative Inquiry, and Design Festa Gallery East in Tokyo. Raised in Boston, I currently live in Pittsburgh, where I earned my BFA from Carnegie Mellon University this past May.
