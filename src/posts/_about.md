My family’s history—and my role in writing it—is central to my work. The participation of my family members in my practice is crucial to understanding the way we share stories and have taught each other to make art. I focus on how we transfer our knowledge and history, orally and through the accretion of artifacts. Our shared material forms the bases of many of my projects, executed through a range of media—including photography, drawing, video, and web development—all of which respond to the diverse nature of the objects in question. 

I am an interdisciplinary artist with a background in Fine Arts and Human Computer Interaction. I have exhibited solo at the Frame Gallery in Pittsburgh, and collaboratively at MuseumLab and the Frank-Ratchye STUDIO for Creative Inquiry. Raised in Boston, I currently live in Washington DC, where I earned my BFA from Carnegie Mellon University in 2020.


I currently work as a freelance designer, developer and content manager, frequently for <a target="_blank" href="https://rlmg.com/">Richard Lewis Media Group</a> and <a target="_blank" href="https://remakelearningdays.org/">Remake Learning Days</a>.
