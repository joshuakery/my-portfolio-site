#OVERVIEW

##This We Design Exhibition card deck is designed to accompany [Design Museum Everywhere](https://designmuseumfoundation.org/)'s online exhibition, [We Design](https://designmuseumfoundation.org/we-design-online-exhibition/). 

From the exhibition:

<quote>

"Our latest exhibition brings together creatives from a wide range of backgrounds to examine and celebrate the range of career paths, applications, and impact in design."

</quote>

##This card deck pairs the exhibition content with written prompts that invite reflection on our career paths and our relationship to the communities in which we design and live.

#RESULTS

##The Design Museum Education Programs team revised a minimally sourced, original card deck to produce this latest deck, featuring 20 new cards researched, written, and source-checked.

For more information regarding my work on this project, please reach out to me.
