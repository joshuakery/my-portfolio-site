I created and mailed home this series of postcards while I was in Tokyo in 2018.

In them, I took on the voice of my great-grandfather, Arthur, on his fictional journey to Japan in the late 1920s.

I printed these postcards with an InkJet printer, as well as their stamps and postmarks, and then sanded and stained them by hand before giving them over to the postal service.
