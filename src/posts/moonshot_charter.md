# VISITOR EXPERIENCE

## Multi-touch table for concurrent voting

Up to 6 visitors gather around a table of digital ballots, debate their positions on the questions presented, vote and see the results displayed on the screen above them.

On a secondary display, visitors can observe the results of their voting in a HUD over a window onto the lunar landscape outside their colony.

## One mode for school trips; another, for casual visitors

In 'Mission' mode, school groups break out into small teams and debate a series of lunar laws in two-minute intervals.

In 'Space Now' mode, regular visitors to the museum consider questions of lunar law at their own pace:

# TECHNICAL HIGHLIGHTS

## Networked experience across five interactives

In 'Mission' mode, interactives share data about each teams' progress at the five stations in the experience, as well as the images teams produce and the current time in the round, all via a server on the local network.
