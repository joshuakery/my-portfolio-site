# For MIT Media Lab Application to PRG and CCC

# ABOUT ME

I'm an artist, designer and developer with a passion for making informal learning experiences.

I'm pursuing grad school to develop my voice for advocating for research-backed projects in for-profit, educational media design.

*I currently program interactive media for museums with [RLMG](https://rlmg.com/).*

*In the past, I was a UX designer at [Aspirant](https://www.aspirant.com/) and taught and wrote curricula for Design Museum Everywhere (now [CoDesign Collaborative](https://codesigncollaborative.org/))*

# PROJECTS 1

## Packing and Cracking

A participatory performance about gerrymandering. We took our audience *by bus* to the site of a community split by voting district lines.

<img src="../post_images/packingandcracking_onabus/packingandcracking_cover.jpg" title="At the site of an apartment complex split into two separate State House voting districts, we invited audience members to react in chalk">

### What I Did

<img src="../post_images/mit-portfolio/chalk_drawing0.jpg" title="Audience members drawing">

- Organized site research trip to decide where to take our audience
    - Visiting a site was a physical, emotional data-visualization experience with implications for exhibition design like in <span style="background:#e5e85f;color:black;padding:0px 5px;border-radius:5px;font-weight:bold">CCC</span>'s [Collective Echoes](https://www.media.mit.edu/projects/collective-echos/overview/)

<br>
<img src="../post_images/packingandcracking_onabus/post-its-collage.jpg" title="Post-it notes from our ideation session for adapting games and activities from the show's virtual run to it's bus version">

- Collaborated in game design session to reformat Packing and Cracking from its virtual version to its in-person, bus version.
    - We centered pedagogy on play and creative input to support learning, relevant to <span style="background:#8fffac;color:black;padding:0px 5px;border-radius:5px;font-weight:bold">PRG</span>'s [AI-literacy curricula](https://www.media.mit.edu/publications/ijaied-ai-ethics-for-middle-school/) or <span style="background:#e5e85f;color:black;padding:0px 5px;border-radius:5px;font-weight:bold">CCC</span>'s work applying learning pedagogy to [communicating difficult concepts to non-experts](https://aclanthology.org/2024.acl-long.388/)

<br>
<img src="../post_images/packingandcracking_onabus/phone-use.jpg" title="Audience member displays their smartphone with a drawing activity from the show underway">

- Designed and developed an audience-facing, mobile web game page
    - We built quiz-format games that gathered audience data, relevant to designing automatic assessment practices in research products like [LevelUp](https://www.media.mit.edu/publications/level-up-2022/) with <span style="background:#8fffac;color:black;padding:0px 5px;border-radius:5px;font-weight:bold">PRG</span>

</div>
<br>

- Conducted semi-structured interviews with over 40 nurses, recruiters, and hiring managers; performed data analysis via affinity diagramming
    - Qualitative research methods like these are practiced by <span style="background:#8fffac;color:black;padding:0px 5px;border-radius:5px;font-weight:bold">PRG</span> and <span style="background:#e5e85f;color:black;padding:0px 5px;border-radius:5px;font-weight:bold">CCC</span>, for example semi-structured interviews in PRG's study of DAILy's [Make-a-Thon](https://www.media.mit.edu/publications/make-a-thon-for-middle-school-ai-educators/)

<img src="../post_images/storytelling_pitchbook/persona_2year.jpg" title="Persona artifact co-created with nurses, recruiters, and hiring managers in a design-thinking workshop">

- Facilitated collaborative design-thinking workshop with users and other stakeholders
    - Co-design like this is a key research practice for <span style="background:#8fffac;color:black;padding:0px 5px;border-radius:5px;font-weight:bold">PRG</span> with [older adults](https://www.media.mit.edu/projects/generative-ai-for-healthy-aging/overview/) and [teachers](https://www.media.mit.edu/publications/preparing-pre-service-teachers-to-integrate-technology-in-k-12-classrooms-standards-and-best-practices/) and for <span style="background:#e5e85f;color:black;padding:0px 5px;border-radius:5px;font-weight:bold">CCC</span>'s Dimitra Dimitrakopoulou's work on the [Generative Dialogue Framework](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/21670811.2022.2075415)

<br>
<img src="../post_images/storytelling_pitchbook/lo-fi_screening_prompts.jpg" title="Lo-fi prototype in Miro">

- Designed iterative prototypes in Miro and Figma; validated with users via think-aloud protocol
    - Iterative prototyping especially applicable to playtesting nethods like in Cassandra Lee's [thesis project](https://www.media.mit.edu/projects/crossroads-game/overview/) or Ivan Sysoev's [work supporting early literacy](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1GYtxRzIqqGuQjhyT11fEM_psG1AWEh3Y/view)

# PROJECTS 5

## Undergraduate Research Assistantship with OH!Lab

[D3](https://d3js.org/) visualizations for [ClassInSight](https://ohlabcmu.wordpress.com/portfolio/classinsight/), a study on software helping teachers improve their classtime behavior by reviewing motion-tracking and speech-tracking data.
