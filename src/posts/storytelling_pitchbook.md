# OVERVIEW

[Aspirant Management Consulting](https://www.aspirant.com/) was contracted by a major hospital network to improve their nursing talent acquisition performance.

# UX CHALLENGE

## Matching Selective Nurses with a Major Hospital

<img src="../post_images/storytelling_pitchbook/nurse_recruitment_illustration.svg" alt="Graphic showing a recruiter trying to pitch benefits of a position to a nursing candidate with other interests." title=" " style="max-width: 450px"/>

Against a post-pandemic backdrop of competitor offers and travel nursing, these recruiters needed to concisely **pitch** to candidates positions that **matched** their interests in pay, benefits, and type of work.

# UX CHALLENGE

## Merging Talent and Marketing Storytelling

<img src="../post_images/storytelling_pitchbook/storytelling_branding_illustration.svg" alt="Graphic showing the Aspirant Storytelling framework and recruiters applying it to Aspirant's Talent Acquisition training." title=" "/>

A collaboration between Aspirant's **Talent Consulting** and **Marking & Innovation** teams, this project needed to sell both teams' strategic brands, including M&I's **Storytelling** framework.

# UX SOLUTION

## Storytelling Pitchbook: Web App Guide for Nurse Recruiters

<browser-container isPrototype="false">
<img src="../post_images/storytelling_pitchbook/hi-fi_desktop.jpg" alt="High-fidelity prototype of storytellling pitch book landing page, open to the 'Start the Story' tab." title="Landing Page, open to the 'Start the Story' tab featuring refined Mind Maps created during our Design Thinking Workshop."/>
</browser-container>

We introduced the **Storytelling Pitchbook**, a bespoke web app breaking down the recruiting process into 5 major steps:

1. Start the Story
2. Know the Candidate
3. Find the Right Fit
4. Get to Yes
5. Close the Call

<br>

<img src="../post_images/storytelling_pitchbook/tab-bar-full.jpg" alt="Detail of tab menu featuring the following tabs: (1) Start the Story, (2) Know the Candidate, (3) Find the Right Fit, (4) Get to Yes, and (5) Close the Call." title="Hi-fi detail: Tab Menu. This menu outlines the sequence recruiters follow in their calls with candidates."/>

At each step, recruiters find a concise guide to **telling the story** of how their hospital is the right match for any candidate.

# UX SOLUTION

## Information Filtering

Leveraging the web format, two sections offer filters to help recruiters drill down to the most pertinent info:

In "**Find the Right Fit**," recruiters apply what they learned in 'Know the Candidate' to identifying the candidate's **best match of nursing units**.

<browser-container isPrototype="false">
<img src="../post_images/storytelling_pitchbook/right-fit.jpg" alt="Detail of high-fidelity prototype displaying the 'Find the Right Fit' tab contents" title="'Find the Right Fit' tab, where recruiters can apply what they learned about a candidate's interests in 'Know the Candidate' to a set of filters for available positions in the hospital network."/>
</browser-container>

In "**Get to Yes**," recruiters filter through a library of talking-points to discuss **benefits most likely to win over a candidate**.

<img src="../post_images/storytelling_pitchbook/talking-points-card.jpg" alt="Detail of high-fidelity prototype's 'Talking Points' card." title="Talking-points card, which dynamically highlights information most relevant to a candidate's background and interests."/>

<browser-container isPrototype="false">

</browser-container>

# UX PROCESS

## Semi-Structured Interviews

We conducted **over 20 hours** of interviews cumulatively with 40 recruiters, hiring managers, and nurses on the recruitment process and what new candidates are looking for.

<img src="../post_images/storytelling_pitchbook/interviews.svg" alt="Graphic showing a video call on a laptop and the text 'x 40'" title=" " style="max-width: 300px"/>

<quote>

New grads might be drawn to our prestige, but they're not all going to be satisfied on a Med-Surg unit.

Some of them only want Critical Care or Pediatrics and they know they can be selective about where they go.

</quote>

<quote>

Nurses coming from smaller hospitals are wary of being lost in such a big one.

The application process has got to reflect that we have both lots of resources and a strong family feel.

</quote>

I analyzed their responses via affinity diagramming and collaborated with Aspirant's [Digital Discovery](https://www.aspirant.com/digital-discovery) team to use their proprietary AI tool to assess and extract further insights from our interview notes.

I used that analysis to structure activites in our collaborative design thinking workshop.

# UX PROCESS

## Journey Map

We further synthesized our analysis into a journey map to validate our understanding of the recruiting process with our stakeholders:

<img src="../post_images/storytelling_pitchbook/journey_map.jpg" alt="Graphic showing journey of nursing candidate and recruiter in the hiring process" title="Journey Map for nursing candidates and recruiters."/>

# UX PROCESS

## Design Thinking Workshop

**18** recruiters, hiring managers, nurses, recruiting administrators, and designers.

**3 x 2hr** sessions using Miro and Zoom.

Together, we **co-created** a suite of design artifacts to define nursing candidates' motivations and actions in the hiring process.

### Empathy Maps

The workshop broke out into 3 smaller groups for its design-thinking exercises. Each group focused on an archetypical candidate of a specific level of experience.

<img src="../post_images/storytelling_pitchbook/empathy_map_2year_.jpg" alt="Graphic showing a 2-year nursing candidate surrounded by notes describing her thoughts and feelings about the process." title="Empathy Map for 2-Year-Experience nursing candidate completed during the workshop"/>

</div>

### Personas, Mind Maps, Task Maps

These three further exercises helped us thoroughly define the candidate experience.

</div>

</div>

### Storytelling

Participants wrapped up the workshop by **mapping their insights** onto the **Storytelling framework** from Aspirant's Marketing & Innovation team:

<div style="max-width:350px; margin-right:auto">

<img src="../post_images/storytelling_pitchbook/aspirant_storytelling.jpg" alt="Graphic showing Aspirant's Storytelling guidelines, which suggest that any customer interaction go through the following steps: (1) Identify the Customer, (2) Set the Context, (3) Introduce the Characters, (4) Isolate the Challenge, (5) Identify Your Part, (6) Path the Resolution, and (7) Capture Lessons Learned." title="Aspirant's Storytelling framework."/>

</div>

# UX PROCESS

## Lo-fi Prototypes

I produced two iterations of lo-fi prototypes to validate our design direction.

We showed the first, below, to our workshop participants in an informal *I think, I like, I wish* exercise.

<browser-container isPrototype="true">
<img src="../post_images/storytelling_pitchbook/lo-fi_screening_prompts.jpg" title="Lo-fi Prototype: Screening Prompts. These prompts would help recruiters ask questions that get at a candidate's core needs." />
</browser-container>

<browser-container isPrototype="true">
<img src="../post_images/storytelling_pitchbook/lo-fi_talking_points.jpg" title="Lo-fi Prototype: Talking Points. This design, expanded into a fully-featured filtering menu, helps recruiters drill down the most important points for a candidate to hear." />
</browser-container>

The second we validated with a Think-Aloud protocol with a subset of recruiters and hiring managers from our workshop.

<img src="../post_images/storytelling_pitchbook/usability-testing.jpg" title="Think Aloud protocol with Lo-fi Prototype: Detail of post-its recording tester's comments." />

Their feedback informed our final designs.
