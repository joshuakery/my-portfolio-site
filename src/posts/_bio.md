I am an experience designer and an interdisciplinary artist with a passion for designing for learning and a background in Fine Arts and Human Computer Interaction.
I am currently an Education Programs Intern at [Design Museum Everywhere](https://designmuseumfoundation.org/) and am freelancing as a web designer and developer. In the past, I have worked as a Teaching Artist at the Children's Museum of Pittsburgh and am eagerly waiting for our museums to fully re-open. Raised in Boston, I currently live in Pittsburgh, where I earned my BFA from Carnegie Mellon University this past May.
