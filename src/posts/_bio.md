I am an interdisciplinary artist with a passion for designing for learning and a background in Fine Arts and Human Computer Interaction. I have worked as a Teaching Artist at the Children's Museum of Pittsburgh and as a designer and developer of educational games and content management systems for virtual instruction with the CMU Entertainment Technology Center and ClassInSight at the CMU Human Computer Interaction Institute. Raised in Boston, I currently live in Pittsburgh, where I earned my BFA from Carnegie Mellon University this past May.
