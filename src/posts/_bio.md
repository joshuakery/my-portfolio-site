I am an interdisciplinary artist with a background in Fine Arts and Human Computer Interaction. I work as a Teaching Artist at the Children's Museum of Pittsburgh and develop augmented reality experiences for the Entertainment Technology Center at Carnegie Mellon University. I have exhibited solo at the Frame Gallery in Pittsburgh, and collaboratively at MuseumLab, the Frank-Ratchye STUDIO for Creative Inquiry, and Design Festa Gallery East in Tokyo. Raised in Boston, I currently live in Pittsburgh, where I earned my BFA from Carnegie Mellon University this past May.
