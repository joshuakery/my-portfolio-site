#ARTICLE LINK

##Coming Soon.

#OVERVIEW

##[Design-Based Research](http://www.designbasedresearch.org/reppubs/DBRC2003.pdf) offers a new lens for educators to see their design process.

##By considering how the designer contributes learning theories and design guidelines to the education community, it creates a new entry to well-worn approaches like Design Thinking, and highlights the power of participatory design like that taught by the [Cambridge D-Lab.](https://www.cpsd.us/office_of_curriculum_and_instruction/innovation_design_lab)

##This November, Mimi Shalf, the Education Programs Apprentice at [Design Museum](https://designmuseumfoundation.org/), and I conducted research for an article on Design-Based Research.

#RESEARCH

##The following people generously gave us their time to speak with us regarding their work and the questions raised by our research into Design-Based Research.
