#CHALLENGE

##Combine the work of 20 animators, a body and performance course, and an experimental ensemble into a night of discovery and play.

##My team designed and built the tower and projection mapping surrounding live musicians in the second half of the exhibition.

##A free-standing frame of projected animations surrounds musicians from the Exploded Ensemble. The videos are remixed live in concert with the music.

Our team live mixed with QLab a collection of previously created animations and a feed of real-time 3D avatars, designed and puppeteered behind-the-curtain by Nik Diamant.

#EVENT DETAILS

##Every Possible Utterance was produced through the collaboration of *Exploded Ensemble*, *Animation Studio*, and *Activating the Body: Physical Computing and Technology in Performance* (all Fall 2019).

The event's theme is based upon Jorge Louis Borges’ short story “The Library of Babel,” prompting a search for the possibility of meaning in randomness and the power of infinity.

The first half of the experience featured exploration and interaction, with sculptures, roving musicians, and performers from *Exploded Ensemble* and *Activating the Body*.

Audience members were invited to don 3D glasses in anticipation of the second half.

The second half presented projection art in concert with a live musical performance in MuseumLab's Assembly Hall.
