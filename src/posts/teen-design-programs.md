#RESEARCH

##In addition to being a resource for teens looking to pursue work in design, the list of programs serves as a benchmarking tool for Design Museum to evaluate its education programs, like Neighborhood Design Project and [Summer Design Project.](https://designmuseumfoundation.org/program/summer-design-project/)

##Teen participants were financially compensated for their time in Neighorhood Design Projectâ€”a model that sets Neighborhood Design Project and its peer programs apart from the majority of youth education programs centered on design.
