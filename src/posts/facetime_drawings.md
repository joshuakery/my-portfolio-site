While I was at school in Tokyo, and my brother was at school just north of Boston, we produced the same drawing in our separate locations over video chat.

The process for producing the drawing was as follows: (1) My brother and I both chose separate, nearby objects to draw and did not tell each other what our object were. (2) I began drawing my object by marking a single line (but it could have been any shape) on my paper; (3) My brother copied that line on his own paper, and then (4) added his own line to make the drawing appear more like his own object. (5) I then copied my brother’s last line, and then (6) added another line to my drawing to make it appear like my object. (7) My brother and I continued taking turns like this until the drawing felt complete.

This has been an iterative project that I’ve conducted with multiple members of my family.

I began with a similar set of rules as I asked my family members to draw with me over video chat. I was more lenient about the anonymity of the objects we selected, like you can see in the images above as my Dad and I both chose different glasses to draw. In the earliest versions of this project, we drew without reference to an object in front of us at all. I asked my brother to draw the fireplace in our home living room from memory, and our father’s face.

I was trying to discover the best way to convey the distance between us. My Mom and I drew the view from our separate windows. Here, they are combined into a view that does not exist. I asked her that we mail each other the drawings so that they swapped locations, just missing the chance to be together in the same place. A few months later, after her drawing returned to the U.S. in my suitcase, I have difficulty remembering which one is hers and which is mine.
