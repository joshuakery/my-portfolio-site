"Brakeman" is an animation I developed in the Fall of 2019 out of a project of learning to draw technical drafts from my grandfather. Its story is a fictional account of an accident that happened to my grandfather's father and his friend while they were working at Bethlehem Steel.

The details of this story are my own invention, but my great-grandfather's friend really did lose his life working for the steel plant.

The environments are hand-drawn, pencil on paper drafts inspired by the technical style of draftsmen-designers at Bethlehem Steel.

The style of the characters was initially inspired by the gestural figure drawings in architectural drafts.
