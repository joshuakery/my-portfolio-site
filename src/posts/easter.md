On Easter, 2018, I exchanged live, framed portraits with my family using Facetime. I posed, in Pittsburgh, PA, for forty minutes during my extended family’s Easter dinner in Milton, MA. In return, my mother and two brothers posed for my “dinner” with my roommate.

The conversation around this piece during my family’s dinner repeatedly acknowledged the presence of the screen at the table. My roommate’s behavior, too, could not get far past this rupture in daily life. I included much of the audio relevant to this issue, so that it might further highlight the construction of the Easter dinner in my homes.
