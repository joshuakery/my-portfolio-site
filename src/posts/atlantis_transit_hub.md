#OVERVIEW

##The San Juan Islands Atlantis Hub needs a new system of transportation displays to cope with the changing paradigm of travel in the region.

##The client, Elizabeth Duerte, is interested in increasing inner-island travel in the area, across **three** transportation methods—planes, trains, and ferries—with a flexible travel plan: the **PTF Pass.**

##We developed this data driven display to help travelers preview and plan their routes, particularly for passholders who can switch to any transportation method with ease.

#FINAL PRODUCT

##For all our users, we present 12 hours of travel options in our main screen.

##For our paying passholders, we show them a special planning page and map-based interaction to streamline their journeys.

<h4>

We preview all travel options through a continuously moving display on our main screen:

With a **time-block based display,** travellers easily compare arrival times and durations for different transportation methods with common destinations:

##To our passholders, we offer PTF Earliest, a quick overview of the fastest means to get to any San Juan Islands destination, accessible only with the PTF Pass:

<h4>

Flexibility was a key need among our stakeholders. We wanted to increase the value of the PTF pass for its passholders by letting them easily recover from canceled or delayed trips and sudden weather changes.

</h4>

</img-pair>

<h4>

Our users needed a faster way to filter through our data. We conceived of a control that would let users quickly bring up potential journeys based on arrival time.

A printed map is mounted below each of our displays. It’s activated by electronics embedded in the PTF pass itself...

<h4>

...When a user taps their pass to the map, a digital footer temporarily appears at the bottom of the main screen.

It's cut right from the PTF Earliest Page: the earliest possible flight, ferry, or train to their destination of choice.

<h4>

We put the perks of the PTF Earliest Page into the pass itself.

In our design, the physical pass is the key to our interactive map. We aimed to strengthen the PTF brand by embodying the essential ways it benefits its passholders—fliexible travel, easy scheduling, and exclusive journeys—in the object of the pass itself.

#BACKGROUND

##Our two user personas and our client needed a data-driven display that made travel easier and more flexible.

<img src="../post_images/atlantis/stakeholder_map.png">



###To prioritize flexibility, we decided it was key to incorporate all three forms of transportation into our display.

<text-pair>

<h4>

Unfortunately, the standard tabular display for transportation hubs wasn't going to cut through this complex data set. 

</h4>

<img src="../post_images/atlantis/departures_standard.jpg">

</text-pair>

###We built our display by first modelling the existing data, which fell into categories that differed for each transportation method:

<img src="../post_images/atlantis/what_is1.png">

We identified categories common across planes, trains, and ferries that were useful for the **functions** of everyday transit, and we selected a few others that contributed to a sense of **connectivity.**

<img src="../post_images/atlantis/what_is2.png">

What could our data display look like instead of the standard?

From our stakeholder needs, it seemed like having a good sense of connections and time-management were priorities, and could be addressed through a display similar to a calendar:

<img src="../post_images/atlantis/what_could_be.jpg">

#PROCESS

##We modeled our first prototype after digital calendars, where time blocks to represent certain “events”— in this case, flights, train rides, and ferry rides.

<img src="../post_images/atlantis/iteration1.jpg">

One clear advantage of representing trips in this way is that the entire duration of travel is captured in the time blocks. Users can see not only what time they’re leaving, but also how long the flight or ride takes, as well as the approximate arrival time. 

<img src="../post_images/atlantis/iteration1_closeup.png">

We organized the time blocks by destination, and included every possible way a traveler could get there by any form of transportation. Flights were represented by orange time blocks, ferries were represeted by green time blocks, and trains were represented by blue time blocks. On the blocks themsleves included other travel information such as gate, dock, and platform.

##We wanted to branch off from this first prototype by re-incorporating other stakeholder needs, individualizing displays and better highlighting trip connections and durations.

We explored three other designs:

##Augmented Reality

<img src="../post_images/atlantis/exploration1.jpg">

*Travellers could filter for their specific travel interests with mobile-based AR.*

##Circuit Board Display

<img src="../post_images/atlantis/exploration2.jpg">

*We could prioritize the visibility of connections over showing all possible routes.*

##Circle Travel

<img src="../post_images/atlantis/exploration3.jpg">

*A radically different design, we could place the destination at the center of a time-blocks circling as if around a clock.*

##Feedback from these initial designs pushed to incoporate more user-needed data, like flight status.

We switched to portrait-orientation to account for additional data columns like flight status as well as overlapping flights.

</h4>

<h4>

We developed a map as the clearest way to show connections between destinations.

#SOLUTION

##To comprehensively address all the data points we needed to show our users, we used motion to expand the size of our display beyond the space of our target screens.

<img-pair>

<img src="../post_images/atlantis/animated_display.png">

<h4>

Users know to look for the journeys by destination and then by flight number or gate, but then how they interpret our “new” time blocks display? How do they know to wait to see time blocks extending off the edge of the screen?

We dropped the distinct pauses on different sections of our display in favor of a continuous motion, forgoing the need to otherwise feedforward that more data will soon be displayed.

##Highlighting Flexibility, Empowerment, and Luxury

These parts of the PTF experience we wanted to emphasize in our pitch. Using the theme of “visualizing and taking control of your time,” we discussed how our display supports flexible, empowered, and luxurious travel.

<img src="../post_images/atlantis/pitch.jpg">

We developed our pitch around these insights:
1. Contemporary displays don’t visualize time effectively.
2. This makes it difficult to make complicated or emergency plans inducing stress.
3. Visualizing time in the form of blocks can reduce stress by making emergency and complicated rescheduling easier.
